This is a simple Strat Roulette bot that randomly selects a strategy.

v1.0

Use text files to hold the strategies, one strat per line. Name CT strats `c_strats.txt` and T strats `t_strats.txt`

You can also specify a map by making files named `t_map` or `c_map`, where `map` is the name of the map. Use the map name as an argument when calling the bot.

Place your bot's token on ***line 1*** of a file called `token.txt` and put your bot's Client ID on ***line 1*** of a file called `client.txt`.

for now this bot is finished, I will add some improvements later.
